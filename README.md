# Loldle Game

The concept of this game is to guess the names of League of Legends champions, which are randomly chosen each time the game is started. All champions are categorized into seven attributes: Gender, Position, Species, Resource, Range Type, Region, and Release Year. You can find a complete list of all the up-to-date champions here: List of champions.

# How does the game work?

Let me explain how the game works. For example, let's say the correct champion is Aatrox. Aatrox falls under the following categories: Male | Top | Darkin, God-Warrior | Manaless | Melee | Runeterra, Shurima | 2013â†‘.

# Gender Category:

If you try guessing Ahri, who is a female champion, the "Female" category will be highlighted in red. If you attempt to guess a male champion, such as Sett, the "Male" category will be highlighted in green.

# Position Category:

Let's go back to the guess of Ahri. Ahri is played in Mid position, so the "Mid" category will be highlighted in red. On the other hand, 
Sett is played in Top position, which means it will light up green. Some champions can be played in multiple positions, like Vayne, who can be played in both Top and Bot. 
If you guess Vayne, the "Bot Top" category will be highlighted in yellow, indicating that only one of these two positions is correct 
(or one of the correct positions, as the right champion may have multiple positions, unlike Aatrox). 
For instance, if the correct champion is Mordekaiser (Top Jungle) and you guess Vayne (Bot Top), the "Bot Top" category will be highlighted in yellow. 
Similarly, if you guess Aatrox, it will also be highlighted in yellow.

# Species Category:

The "Species" category works similarly to the "Positions" category.

# Resource Category:

The "Resource" category is straightforward and functions similarly to the "Gender" category.

# Range Type Category:

There are three types of range: Melee, Ranged, and Melee Ranged. If the correct champion is Melee and you guess a Ranged champion, it will be highlighted in red. Guessing a Melee champion will be highlighted in green. If you try guessing Jayce (who is one of the rare examples of Melee Ranged), it will be highlighted in yellow. This rule applies vice versa if the correct champion is Ranged (Jayce guess will be yellow again). If the correct champion is Melee Ranged, guessing either a Melee or Ranged type champion will result in them being highlighted in red. Guessing a Melee Ranged champion will be highlighted in green.

# Region Category:

The "Region" category operates similarly to the "Positions" category.

# Release Year Category:

The "Release Year" category works as follows. Let's use Aatrox as an example. He was released in 2013. If you try guessing Ryze (released in 2009), it will be displayed as "2009â†‘" in red, indicating that Ryze was released in 2009, but the correct champion was released in a later year. If you try guessing Yone (released in 2020), it will be displayed as "2020â†“" in red, suggesting that Yone was released in 2020, but the correct champion was released in an earlier year. However, if you guess Jinx (released in 2013, just like Aatrox), it will be displayed as "2013" in green.

# Changes from the original game:

This game is inspired by an online game called Loldle: Loldle Classic. However, I have made a few changes to enhance the gameplay. First, I have introduced a "Give up" command, which reveals the correct champion and its corresponding categories. Additionally, I have removed the "Other" gender type and replaced it with an accurate gender representation for each champion(No , I'm not promoting any kind of sexism! Don't cancel me! ðŸ˜„)

# Changes to Categories:

I have also made some adjustments to the "Positions" and "Regions" of certain champions, which, in my opinion, feel more appropriate. Here are a few examples:

Blitzcrank: Changed Gender from "Other" to "Male"
Ezreal: Added Runeterra to Region
Katarina: Added Icathia to Region
Kindred: Changed Gender from "Other" to "Female"
Lucian: Added Runeterra to Region
Malphite: Added Mid to Positions
Maokai: Added Jungle to Positions
Pantheon: Added Top to Positions
Senna: Added Runeterra to Region
Seraphine: Added Mid and Support to Positions
Sylas: Added Jungle to Positions
Vladimir: Resource changed from "Bloodthirst" to "Health"
Zac: Added Top to Positions
Zed: Added Jungle to Positions
Zilean: Added Mid to Positions
Updates and Ownership of the Game:

League of Legends introduces a new champion approximately every three months. Therefore, I will strive to keep this game updated accordingly. However, I want to clarify that I do not claim ownership of the game, as I am not the original creator. The link to the original game can be found here: Original Game

Enjoy playing the Loldle Game and have fun guessing the champions! If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to let me know.
